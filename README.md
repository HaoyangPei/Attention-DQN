Paper: [*Neuroevolution of Self-Interpretable Agents*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08165) by Yujin Tang, Duong Nguyen, David Ha. (Here is the original experiment: [CarRacingExperiment](https://github.com/google/brain-tokyo-workshop/tree/master/AttentionAgent))

The author uses input transformation, patch selection, and action generation to train a selective-attention-based RL model and does experiments on CarRacing and DoomTakeCover, which have good performance even using a small LSTM controller.
